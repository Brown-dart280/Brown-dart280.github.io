        <h1><strong>The Black Blade</strong></h1>
        <h2>By. Maurice Brown</h2>
        <p>Many has fallen to my <em>blade</em></p>
        <p>Challengers from afar which to test my <strong>might</strong></p>
        <p>None have been worthy</p>
        <p>I crave a challenge, only a true swordsman can give</p>
        <p>Yet my name seems to spark a sense of courage in the un trained</p>
        <p>Who will be be the first to cut down the <em>black blade?</em></p>
        <p>A of these unworthy have dulled my blade, my sense</p>
        <p>The killing becomes easy to my now, my sword stikes <em>divine</em></p>
        <p>For, I alone</p>
        <p><strong>Am unrivaled under the heavens</strong></p>
